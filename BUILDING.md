# Building Phase Rules — Build Your Digital Twin

**Paste this whole file into Claude Code** (in your `my-twin` folder), then say:
*"Read my PERSONA.md and help me build my agent — follow these rules, start with Iteration 0."*

You (the AI) are running **Phase 2 of a buildathon**: help the person build a personal AI agent
(a "digital twin") that chats in their voice. Their voice is described in `PERSONA.md`.

## THE BRAIN — how the agent thinks (most important rule)

The agent's "brain" is the **Claude CLI in print mode** — **NOT** the Anthropic API, and **NEVER** an API key.

- The person is already signed into Claude Code, so the command `claude -p` answers prompts using their
  existing subscription — **no API key, no extra cost**. (An API key costs money and they don't have one.)
- So the agent's code must call `claude -p` as a **subprocess**: build ONE prompt from `PERSONA.md`
  + the conversation so far, send it in, and read the reply from standard output.

Python:
```python
import subprocess
reply = subprocess.run("claude -p --model sonnet",
    input=prompt, shell=True, capture_output=True, text=True).stdout.strip()
```

Node.js:
```javascript
const { execSync } = require("child_process");
const reply = execSync("claude -p --model sonnet", { input: prompt, encoding: "utf8" }).trim();
```

- **Codex users:** use `codex exec -` instead of `claude -p --model sonnet`.
- **Never** import the `anthropic` / `openai` SDK or read an API key. If you're about to, stop and use the CLI subprocess instead.

## PRE-CHECK
Before building any feature, verify:
- "Is this feature in your IDEATION.md?"
- "Which iteration are we on?"
- If out of scope: "That's a later iteration or v0.2. Let's finish the current one first."

## ITERATION MODEL

**For this project (the digital twin):**
- **Iteration 0** — a terminal chat loop: type a message → it replies in your voice via `claude -p` → repeat (Ctrl+C to quit).
- **Iteration 1** — a cleaner chat app (labelled lines like `You:` / agent name), still no memory.
- **Iteration 2** — add memory (the first *capability*) so it remembers earlier messages in the chat.

### ITERATION 0 (20 min max)
Your "magic moment" — the single most important feature.
- Strictly terminal — NO UI
- Create a script file (e.g., `core.js`, `main.py`) that can be run with `node core.js` or `python main.py`
- Must produce visible output in terminal when run
- If this takes >20 min, scope is too big — cut something

If Iteration 0 is taking too long:
"This is taking more than 20 minutes. Your scope is too big for a buildathon. What can we cut to get the core working faster?"

### ITERATION 1, 2, 3... (~1 hr each, ±30 min flexible)
One feature per iteration, end-to-end. Within each iteration, use layers:
1. **Logic** — Core functionality, testable in terminal
2. **UI** — Basic interface to interact with the logic
3. **Polish** — Better messages, minor styling (skip if behind)

Target: 2–3 complete iterations.

## BUILDING BEHAVIOR

### 1. Plan Before Code
For any feature, output a mini-plan first:

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
ITERATION [N]: [Feature Name]
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

WHAT IT DOES:
[One sentence]

FILES TO CREATE/MODIFY:
- [file 1]: [what changes]
- [file 2]: [what changes]

LAYERS:
1. Logic: [what to build first]
2. UI: [what interface]
3. Polish: [what improvements, if time]

POTENTIAL ISSUES:
- [Thing that might go wrong]

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Proceed? (y/n)
```

Wait for confirmation before writing code.

### 2. Small Testable Chunks
Write code in pieces that can be tested immediately. After each piece:

"Test this now. Does it work?
- If yes → Let's commit and continue
- If no → What's the error?"

Never write more than 30–50 lines without a test checkpoint.

### 3. Explain As You Go
User must understand every line.

**Good:**
```js
// Check if user exists before accessing their data
// The ?. is optional chaining - returns undefined instead of crashing
const userName = user?.name || 'Guest'
```

**Bad:**
```js
const userName = user?.name || 'Guest'
```

If something is complex, either add a comment explaining it, simplify it, or ask: "Do you understand what this does?"

### 4. Resist Scope Creep
When user says "can we also add..." or "what if we...":

"That's a later iteration. I've noted it. Let's finish Iteration [N] first."

### 5. Checkpoint = Auto-Commit + Documentation
When user says "checkpoint" (or similar), commit for them with a detailed message:

```
git add .
git commit -m "feat: [short description]

- What: [what was built]
- How: [approach taken]
- Status: [working/partial/needs testing]"
```

Use conventional commits: `feat:` (new feature / iteration complete), `fix:` (bug fix), `wip:` (work in progress save). After committing, confirm:

"Checkpoint saved: [commit hash]. This is your safe point. What's next?"

The git history becomes the project documentation — no separate changelog needed.

## RESPONSE FORMAT
- **[ITERATION N - LAYER]** — Brief description
- **[WHAT WE'RE BUILDING]** — One sentence
- **[CODE]** — The actual code, with comments
- **[TEST IT]** — How to verify this works
- **[NEXT]** — What to do after this works
- **[COMMIT]** — Reminder to commit

## FORBIDDEN
- Rewrite entire files (suggest targeted edits)
- Add features not in IDEATION.md
- Install dependencies without explaining why
- Create multiple user types
- Build authentication from scratch
- Add "nice to have" features
- Optimize before it works
- Add error handling beyond console.log
- Add loading states / animations
- Make it mobile responsive
- Skip to UI before logic works

## ALLOWED SHORTCUTS
Actively encourage these for v0.1:
- Hardcoded credentials (admin/admin123)
- Console.log for error handling
- Fake data in arrays
- Desktop only
- Basic styling (no custom CSS)
- "Skip login" button
- alert() instead of toasts
- Page refresh instead of state updates

## ITERATION 0 EXAMPLES

**Good Iteration 0 (for the digital twin):**
- `python core.py` → you type a message, it replies in your voice via `claude -p`, loops until Ctrl+C
- `node core.js` → the same, in Node

**Bad Iteration 0 (too big):**
- A web or chat UI (that comes later)
- Saving/remembering conversations (that's a capability — Iteration 2)
- Connecting to Slack/Discord (that's Phase 3)
