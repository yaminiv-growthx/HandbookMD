# Before You Arrive

Spend about **15 minutes tonight** so you arrive ready to build. You only need two things: **Node.js** and **one AI tool** (Claude Code recommended). Once Claude is installed, it can set up anything else for you on the day — so this list is short on purpose.

> 🧘 You don't need to understand all of it. Install it, run the check at the bottom, and you're set. Mentors will fix anything that didn't work tomorrow.

> ⚙️ Use the **Tool** and **Computer** toggles at the top of this page to match what you have.

## 1. Install Node.js

:::win
1. Go to **nodejs.org** and download the **LTS** version.
2. Run the installer (keep clicking Next).
3. Open your **terminal (PowerShell)** — you'll use it in the next step.
:::
:::mac
1. Go to **nodejs.org**, download the **LTS** version, and install it.
2. Open the **Terminal app** — you'll use it in the next step.

## 2. Install your AI tool

Install **Claude Code first** — once it's running and signed in, it can install everything else you need (even Python) for you.

:::claude
In your terminal:

💻 **RUN**
```
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

Then start it and sign in with your Claude account:

💻 **RUN**
```
claude
```

Sign in when it asks, then type `/exit` to return to the terminal.
:::
:::codex
In your terminal:

💻 **RUN**
```
npm install -g @openai/codex
```

Then sign in:

💻 **RUN**
```
codex login
```
:::

## 3. Python (optional)

You only need Python if you choose the Python path tomorrow — and your AI tool can install it for you once it's running. **You can skip this for now.**

## Final check

In your terminal, confirm Node is installed:

💻 **RUN**
```
node --version
```

You should see a version like `v20.x` (not an error). Then check your AI tool replies:

:::claude
💻 **RUN**
```
claude -p "say hi in one word"
```
:::
:::codex
💻 **RUN**
```
echo "say hi in one word" | codex exec -
```
:::

> ✅ Got a version number and a one-word reply? You're ready — see you tomorrow.

> 💡 We may share a one-step setup script on the day, but doing this tonight means you can start building right away.
